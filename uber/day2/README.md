My Daily Coding Problems #2 May 11, 2019, [Uber], [Hard]

These are my attempts to solve coding problems provided by https://dailycodingproblem.com

These guys tend to solve the problems in Python, but this reporsitory is a collection of my attempts to do the same in Java

=========================   task in question ========================

This problem was asked by Uber.

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

Follow-up: what if you can't use division?

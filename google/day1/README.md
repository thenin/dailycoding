My Daily Coding Problems 
May 10, 2019

These are my attempts to solve coding problems provided by https://dailycodingproblem.com

These guys tend to solve the problems in Python, but this reporsitory is a collection of my attempts to do the same in Java


=========================   task in question ========================

This problem was recently asked by Google.

Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

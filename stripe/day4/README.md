My Daily Coding Problems #4 May 12, 2019, [Stripe], [Hard]

These are my attempts to solve coding problems provided by https://dailycodingproblem.com

These guys tend to solve the problems in Python, but this reporsitory is a collection of my attempts to do the same in Java

=========================   task in question ========================

Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array. The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.

For example, the input [3, 4, -1, 1] should give 2. The input [1, 2, 0] should give 3.

You can modify the input array in-place.
